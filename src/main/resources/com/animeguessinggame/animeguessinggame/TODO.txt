Make scoreboard work (client must send their score to server then fetch other clients' score)
    When score calculated, Client sends score to server
    Server recieves score and puts it in list with userName
    When server gets score from all users, server sends score back to all clients
    Client puts score and UserNames in leaderboard


Make end of game work (very simple, just add a screen that says "The End")
